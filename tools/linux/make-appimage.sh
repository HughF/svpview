# make-appimage.sh — build a portable Linux binary.
#
# The problem this solves is glibc, not packaging. A binary built on a
# rolling-release machine binds symbol versions that do not exist anywhere
# else: on the development box it wants cfsetispeed@GLIBC_2.42 and
# sqrtf@GLIBC_2.43, so it refuses to start on every stable distribution there
# is. Symbol versions are chosen by the linker against the host's libc, so no
# amount of source-level care avoids it. The only fix is to build against an
# older glibc.
#
# That is done here without root and without a container runtime: an Ubuntu
# 22.04 base filesystem is unpacked and entered with bubblewrap, which needs
# only unprivileged user namespaces. Ubuntu 22.04 carries glibc 2.35 and
# SDL 2.0.20 — the SDL floor is 2.0.18, below which SDL_RenderGeometryRaw
# does not exist and the vendored Nuklear renderer will not link.
#

# ---- SDL, built the way it is meant to be redistributed ------------------
#
# Not the distribution's libSDL2. Debian and Ubuntu build it with every
# backend linked directly, so their library carries hard NEEDED entries for
# nineteen X11, Wayland, DRM and audio libraries — libdecor-0.so.0 among
# them, which plenty of systems do not have. The loader resolves all of those
# before main() runs, so one missing library on the target machine and the
# program does not start at all, which is exactly the failure an AppImage
# exists to prevent.
#
# Built from source with the *-shared options instead, SDL opens each backend
# with dlopen when it needs it and does without the ones that are absent.
# That is what upstream ships and what makes a bundled SDL safe to carry.
